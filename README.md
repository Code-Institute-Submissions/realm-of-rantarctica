## UX (User Experience)
### Project Goals
This project was created to offer the user a simple, yet engaging and visually appealing gaming experience. The game is geared more towards users with a passion for the fantasy genre, but is intended to be accessible and fun for any user at the same time. A combination of strategy and an interactive and animated game space needs to offer the user a satisfactory user experience whilst generating interest for continued use of the site and other future offerings from the developer. 

#### User Goals
* A single page site that displays all game content without needing to navigate elsewhere
* A range of character types to play as
* Various selectable fullscreen backgrounds with vibrant colours
* Clearly visible data for each character's charateristics
* Multiple difficulty levels in the form of limited time for each round
* The option to restart or quit the game at any time
* A summary of the match's most interesting statistics when done
* Playable on all screen sizes and devices

#### User Stories

##### Ms A Stark 
<em>"I'd like to be able to play the game on any any device with the same level of User Experience, irrespective of screen size. It would also be nice to play in either portrait or landscape mode on mobile devices."</em>

##### Mr Ollivander
<em>"A fantasy game needs a good variety of characters to allow immersion for the user. I'd like to see at least 10 characters with which to start, with future expansion packs being a bonus. All characters should be nicely balanced in terms of their stats, with no obviously overpowered characters being virtually unbeatable. I would also like the opportunity to set a difficulty level at the beginning of each match to increase replayability."</em>

##### Dr Perilous
<em>"The underlying gameplay is of course important, though I believe it must be coupled with a vibrant colour scheme to suit the fantasy genre. It would be limiting to play with the same background all the time, so selectable background would be a very nice addition. If at all posiible, some basic character animations would make the game less static and lend more credibilty to the claim of it being a fighting game, albeit with what basically amounts to a card game."</em>

### Design Choices
Realm of Rantarctica is a game in the fantasy genre. As such, the overall style of the game reflects that in terms of colour, graphical style, font type and page layout. Knowledge gained from previous projects, coupled with user feedback, heavily influenced my decisions for this project.

#### Fonts
In order to fit the fantasy nature of the game, unconventional fonts were selected from **Google Fonts**.  The selected fonts have to be slighty quirky and more cartoony in design, while still being legible. Sample phrases featured in the game were entered in **Google Fonts** to see how they were displayed. Ultimately, the fonts below were selected to be used in clearly defined areas in the game.
* [Girassol](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Girassol) - used for the game title and character display names
* [Acme](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Acme) - used for character and game stats
* [Mansalva](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mansalva) - used for buttons, alerts and all other game text

#### Icons
All icons used in the Realm of Rantarctica were taken from <a href="https://craftpix.net/" target="_blank">CraftPix</a>, where I have a paid subscription.  Although some content on **CraftPix** is free, the majority of icons require a paid subscription to access.  The license allows me to use and modify any images from **CraftPix** in any number of projects, but not to resell it.  

#### Images
All images, including backgrounds and character sprites were taken from <a href="https://craftpix.net/" target="_blank">CraftPix</a>.  I have a paid subscription with **CraftPix**, and the majority of images and sprites used require a paid subscription to download and use. The license allows me to use and edit images as I wish, though the only changes made were resizing, applying filters and joining sprites to allow animation of characters.

#### Colours
I decided on using <a href="https://coolors.co/003049-d62828-f77f00-fcbf49-eae2b7" target="_blank">this</a> colour palette from **coolors.co**.  All five colours complement each other very well, and provide a good level of contrast to increase legibility and clearly define different areas of the game display.  A lighter shade of *Prussian Blue* was also selected to add to the colour palette.  The colours and there uses are listed below:

##### #003049 (Prussian Blue)
* Background colour in text areas displaying character and game stats and data
* Background colour for level names on the **Battleground Selection** screen

* Upper and lower border colours for the **VS** text on the battle screen
* Background colour to highlight the players chosen stat with which to battle
