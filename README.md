### Project Goals
This project was created to offer the user a simple, yet engaging and visually appealing gaming experience. The game is geared more towards users with a passion for the fantasy genre, but is intended to be accessible and fun for any user at the same time. A combination of strategy and an interactive and animated game space needs to offer the user a satisfactory user experience whilst generating interest for continued use of the site and other future offerings from the developer. 

#### User Goals:
* A single page site that displays all game content without needing to navigate elsewhere
* A range of character types to play as
* Various selectable fullscreen backgrounds with vibrant colours
* Clearly visible data for each character's charateristics
* Multiple difficulty levels in the form of limited time for each round
* The option to restart or quit the game at any time
* A summary of the match's most interesting statistics when done
* Playable on all screen sizes and devices
