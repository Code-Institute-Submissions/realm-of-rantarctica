## UX (User Experience)
### Project Goals
This project was created to offer the user a simple, yet engaging and visually appealing gaming experience. The game is geared more towards users with a passion for the fantasy genre, but is intended to be accessible and fun for any user at the same time. A combination of strategy and an interactive and animated game space needs to offer the user a satisfactory user experience whilst generating interest for continued use of the site and other future offerings from the developer. 

#### User Goals:
* A single page site that displays all game content without needing to navigate elsewhere
* A range of character types to play as
* Various selectable fullscreen backgrounds with vibrant colours
* Clearly visible data for each character's charateristics
* Multiple difficulty levels in the form of limited time for each round
* The option to restart or quit the game at any time
* A summary of the match's most interesting statistics when done
* Playable on all screen sizes and devices

#### User Stories:

##### Ms A Stark: 
<em>"I'd like to be able to play the game on any any device with the same level of User Experience, irrespective of screen size. It would also be nice to play in either portrait or landscape mode on mobile devices."</em>

##### Mr Ollivander: 
<em>"A fantasy game needs a good variety of characters to allow immersion for the user. I'd like to see at least 10 characters with which to start, with future expansion packs being a bonus. All characters should be nicely balanced in terms of their stats, with no obviously overpowered characters being virtually unbeatable. I would also like the opportunity to set a difficulty level at the beginning of each match to increase replayability."</em>

##### Dr Perilous: 
<em>"The underlying gameplay is of course important, though I believe it must be coupled with a vibrant colour scheme to suit the fantasy genre. It would be limiting to play with the same background all the time, so selectable background would be a very nice addition. If at all posiible, some basic character animations would make the game less static and lend more credibilty to the claim of it being a fighting game, albeit with what basically amounts to a card game."</em>

#### Site Owner Goals:
* Deliver on User Stories as far as possible
* Create an engaging and enjoyable fantasy game with replay value
* Gain sufficient user interest to ensure a user base for future releases
* Add more character content and features in future expansions
