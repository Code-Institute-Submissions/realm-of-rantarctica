### Design Choices
Realm of Rantarctica is a game in the fantasy genre. As such, the overall style of the game reflects that in terms of colour, graphical style, font type and page layout. Knowledge gained from previous projects, coupled with user feedback, heavily influenced my decisions for this project.

#### Fonts
In order to fit the fantasy nature of the game, unconventional fonts were selected from **Google Fonts**.  The selected fonts have to be slighty quirky and more cartoony in design, while still being legible. Sample phrases featured in the game were entered in **Google Fonts** to see how they were displayed. Ultimately, the fonts below were selected to be used in clearly defined areas in the game.
* [Girassol](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Girassol) - used for the game title and character display names
* [Acme](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Acme) - used for character and game stats
* [Mansalva](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mansalva) - used for buttons, alerts and all other game text

#### Icons
All icons used in the Realm of Rantarctica were taken from <a href="https://craftpix.net/" target="_blank">CraftPix</a>, where I have a paid subscription.  Although some content on **CraftPix** is free, the majority of icons require a paid subscription to access.  The license allows me to use and modify any images from **CraftPix** in any number of projects, but not to resell it.  

#### Images
All images, including backgrounds and character sprites were taken from <a href="https://craftpix.net/" target="_blank">CraftPix</a>.  I have a paid subscription with **CraftPix**, and the majority of images and sprites used require a paid subscription to download and use. The license allows me to use and edit images as I wish, though the only changes made were resizing, applying filters and joining sprites to allow animation of characters.

#### Colours
I decided on using <a href="https://coolors.co/003049-d62828-f77f00-fcbf49-eae2b7" target="_blank">this</a> colour palette from **coolors.co**.  All five colours complement each other very well, and should provide a good level of contrast to increase legibility and clearly define different areas of the game display.  A lighter shade of *Prussian Blue* was also selected to add to the colour palette.  The colours and their *intended* uses are listed below:

##### #003049 (Prussian Blue)
